**I am** a technologist at heart with a passion for agile methodologies. My journey in the tech world has consistently revolved around tackling technological advancements and integrating them into organisational frameworks. As a recognized speaker, author, and industry innovator, **I've dedicated** my career to helping organisations harness the power of technology to drive evolutionary and revolutionary change.

Over the years, **I've leveraged** my deep technical knowledge to implement impactful technological solutions that bring about significant business transformations. **I've worked closely** with tech teams, leaders, and product managers, guiding them in leveraging technology to reduce time to market, foster innovation, and maximize value delivery.

Transitioning from a pure technologist to an agilist, **I've championed** the decentralization and democratization of tech processes. My approach has always been to evolve traditional work methods, integrating cutting-edge technology to establish efficient processes and drive change through culture, technology, and collaboration.

Being a Microsoft MVP in Developer Technologies since 2008 is a testament to my dedication to the tech community. **I've also been** an accredited trainer with Scrum.org since 2010. In 2010, Microsoft acknowledged my technological contributions by naming me their MVP of the year. In 2012, **I keynoted** the Californian Visual Studio 2012 launch events. Further solidifying my commitment to the tech world, in 2013, **I co-authored** *Professional ALM with Visual Studio 2012* for Wrox.

After returning to the UK in 2013, **I've been an active voice** in the tech community, speaking at various tech conferences, including Techorama, NDC, DevDay Baku, and many more, sharing my insights and contributions to technology.

**I currently reside** in Scotland, continually exploring the ever-evolving world of technology alongside my family.
