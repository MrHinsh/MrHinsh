# Hi üëã My name is Martin Hinshelwood

#### Lean-Agile & DevOps Advisor with 20+ years experience

_Executive Technology Advisor | Professional Scrum Trainer | Professional Kanban Trainer | Microsoft MVP: GitHub & Azure DevOps | Neuro-divergent & Dyslexic_

**I am** a technology-focused passionate agile leader with a track record of inspiring, encouraging, and igniting momentum in organisations. As a featured speaker, author, and industry thought leader, **I help** organisations build a vision and execute evolutionary and revolutionary change. **My** deep technical knowledge, business insight, and experience drive impactful change for organisations. 

**I mentor** and support teams, leaders, and product managers in reducing their time to market and increasing their ability to innovate while maximising value delivery. 

**I've transitioned** from being a technologist to an agilist and have successfully helped organisations decentralise, democratise, and evolve their way of work to build extraordinary processes and drive organisational change through culture, technology, and teamwork. 

**I'm honored** to be a Microsoft MVP in Developer Technologies, a title I've held since 2008. **I've also been** an accredited trainer with Scrum.org since 2010. In 2010, **I was named** Microsoft MVP of the year by Microsoft, and in 2012, **I had the privilege** to keynote the Californian Visual Studio 2012 launch events for them. In 2013, **I co-wrote** *Professional ALM with Visual Studio 2012* for Wrox.

Since moving back to the UK in 2013, **I've spoken** at many conferences, including Techorama, NDC, DevDay Baku, DevOps Pro, Scrum Day London, Deliver Agile, Build Stuff, Agile In Africa, ScotSoft, Agile Methods, & DevOps Vilnius. 

**I currently live** in Scotland with my wife and two kids.
